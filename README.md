# Game Jam - Marathon Runner

## About
This game was created as a part of the Game Jam event at *FIT BUT* (subject *1ZHERV*).
My theme was **Night and Day**.

## Description
You are Pheidippides and you have to deliver the message of victory to the Athens.

How many days and nights can you run without stopping? Watch out for obstacles on the road, because the moment you stop, you die.

During the night, you can use your torch to see oncoming obstacles, but be wary, it is quite unreliable.

## Where to play?
This game is available on my personal school [website](https://www.stud.fit.vutbr.cz/~xaugus14/) under the tab Game Jam as a WebGL game.

## Controls
- `space` - Jump
